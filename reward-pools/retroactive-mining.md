# Retroactive Mining Rewards

7.5% \(`75,000,000 DYDX`\) will be distributed to past dYdX users who complete certain trading milestones on the Protocol. To claim earned tokens, users will need to trade on dYdX’s Layer 2 Perpetuals and achieve their respective claim milestone.

**Objectives**

* Reward historical dYdX users with a retroactive reward based on past usage
* Incentivize historical dYdX users to trade Layer 2 Perpetuals

## Overview

The Protocol’s success is the result of thousands of community members who have been trading on the Protocol and its predecessors over the past three years.

DYDX has been allocated to past users of dYdX based on a snapshot ending \[July 7, 2021, at 15:00:00 UTC.\] There are five allocation tiers that depend on the usage across all dYdX products. To claim DYDX, historical users must meet the following milestones on [Layer 2 Perpetuals](https://trade.dydx.exchange) within the first 28-day epoch. Any trading on dYdX Layer 2 prior to ~~\[July 7, 2021, 15:00:00 UTC\]~~ will apply towards the Claim Milestone. Rewards will be claimable at the end of the epoch.

The following table displays the number of users eligible for the Retroactive Mining Reward by Claim Milestone Tier:

Any unclaimed DYDX at the end of the first epoch will be forfeited and automatically distributed to the Community Treasury.

## **FAQ**

### **Who is eligible for retroactive rewards?**

dYdX users who have traded dYdX products \(perpetual, margin, spot\) or deposited funds into dYdX’s borrow / lend pools are eligible to receive DYDX through retroactive rewards.

dYdX's current and past smart contracts are included below:

* Expo Protocol here
* Solo Protocol here
* Perpetual Protocol on Layer 1 here
* Perpetual Protocol on Layer 2 [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd54f502e184b6b739d7d27a6410a67dc462d69c8)

In line with restrictions on the availability of DYDX and the Protocol in the United States, the retroactive allocation is not available to users who are, or who we have determined to be, headquartered, located, incorporated in, or a resident of, the United States.

### **How do I claim my retroactive rewards?**

Users can claim their retroactive rewards on the dYdX Governance front-end \[insert url and image based on UI\].

Users will only first be able to claim rewards approximately 7 days \(**Waiting Period**\) after the end of Epoch 0. Once Epoch 0 concludes, all earned rewards will be able to be claimed in perpetuity.

### What happens if I don’t reach my claim milestone?

To claim the full allocation of DYDX tokens, users must meet their specific target volume tier trading perpetuals on dYdX Layer 2.

Earned retroactive rewards are linearly claimable with the target volume. For example, if a user’s claim milestone is $5K in trading volume on Layer 2 perpetuals but the user only trades $2.5K in volume over the course of epoch 0, the user will only be able to claim 50% of the allocated reward.

Any unclaimed DYDX at the end of the epoch 0 will be forfeited and automatically distributed to the community treasury.

### When can I withdraw and transfer my claimed DYDX retroactive rewards?

Earned DYDX tokens via the Retroactive Rewards will become transferable at the end of epoch 0. DYDX token holders are required to wait approximately `7 days` \(**Waiting Period**\) after the end of the epoch to claim their tokens. Once tokens have been claimed, they can be transferred or delegated to dYdX governance.
