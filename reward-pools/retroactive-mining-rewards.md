# Retroactive Mining Rewards

7.5% \(`75,000,000 DYDX`\) will be distributed to past dYdX users who complete certain trading milestones on the Protocol. To claim earned tokens, users will need to trade on dYdX’s Layer 2 Perpetuals and achieve their respective claim milestone.

**Objectives**

* Reward historical dYdX users with a retroactive reward based on past usage
* Incentivize historical dYdX users to trade Layer 2 Perpetuals

## Overview

The dYdX Layer 2 Protocol’s success is the result of thousands of community members who have been trading on the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol and its predecessors over the past three years.

DYDX has been allocated to historical users of all dYdX protocols based on a snapshot ending **July 26, 2021, at 00:00:00 UTC**. There are five allocation tiers that depend on the usage across all dYdX products. 

To claim DYDX, historical users must meet the following milestones on [Layer 2 Perpetuals](https://trade.dydx.exchange) within the first 28-day epoch \(Epoch 0\):

Any historical volume on the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol counts towards a user’s claim milestone. Rewards will be claimable at the end of the epoch. Any unclaimed DYDX at the end of Epoch 0 will be forfeited and automatically distributed to the community treasury. 

## **FAQ**

### **Who is eligible for retroactive rewards?**

Past dYdX users who have traded dYdX products \(perpetual, margin, spot\) on Layer 2 or Layer 1 or deposited funds into dYdX’s borrow / lend pools are eligible to receive DYDX through retroactive rewards.

In line with restrictions on the availability of DYDX and the dYdX Layer 2 Protocol in the United States, retroactive mining is not available to users located in, or incorporated or otherwise established in, or a resident of, the United States or any other prohibited jurisdiction. Any accounts that were clearly associated with bot activity speculating on a future airdrop were also excluded from retroactive rewards.

### How much DYDX did I earn in the retroactive rewards program?

Past dYdX users can view their past activity and tier for Retroactive Mining at [trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/rewards](https://trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/rewards). To earn DYDX, users are encouraged to trade on the Protocol at [trade.dydx.exchange](https://trade.dydx.exchange/) to meet their criteria threshold.

### What happens if I don’t reach my claim milestone?

To claim the full allocation of DYDX tokens, users must meet their specific target volume tier trading perpetuals on dYdX Layer 2.

Earned retroactive rewards are linearly claimable with the target volume. For example, if a user’s claim milestone is $5K in trading volume on Layer 2 perpetuals but the user only trades $2.5K in volume over the course of epoch 0, the user will only be able to claim 50% of the allocated reward.

Any unclaimed DYDX at the end of the epoch 0 will be forfeited and automatically distributed to the community treasury.

### When can I withdraw and transfer my claimed DYDX retroactive rewards?

Earned DYDX tokens via the Retroactive Mining Rewards will become transferable at the end of Epoch 0. Users will be able to claim their retroactive rewards approximately `7 days` \(**Waiting Period**\) after the end of Epoch 0. Once Epoch 0 concludes, all earned rewards will be able to be claimed in perpetuity.

On approximately **September 8, 2021 15:00:00 UTC**, `8 days` after the end of Epoch 0, the initial transfer restrictions will be lifted and earned DYDX tokens via the Retroactive Mining Rewards can be withdrawn, transferred, or delegated.
